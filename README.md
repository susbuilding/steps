# steps

### Steps is a game designed for kids to learn code and problem solving. The idea is to get the panda to the bamboo stick in the least number of "steps" or moves. There are two ways to move the panda. You can click the buttons along the bottom, or you can use the drag and drop buttons along the middle to run many moves at once.
